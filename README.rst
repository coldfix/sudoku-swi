----------

Lightweight Static Web Interface for sudoku generator, visible on
sudoku.coldfix.de_.

.. _sudoku.coldfix.de: http://sudoku.coldfix.de

This is coded in illegably ugly PHPâ€¦ shame on me. Please, don't blame me for
the mistakes I've done years ago.

The thing itself isn't really useful, but I had already coded the sudoku
generator a while back when I was in school, so it wasn't much effort to
provide a web-interface. I am now setting the code free, so you can decide on
your own, whether you want to look at such ugliness.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _generator: https://github.com/coldfix/sudoku-cli

Build the generator:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/coldfix/sudoku-swi
    cd sudoku-swi
    apt-get install base-devel boost-dev
    make

Now, serve the ``html/`` folder with CGI enabled. For example, use lighttpd
to serve on http://localhost:3030:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install lighttpd php php-cgi fcgi
    lighttpd -Df lighttpd.conf


Docker
------

You can run the site inside a docker container using lighttpd:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/coldfix/sudoku-swi
    cd sudoku-swi
    docker build . -t sudoku
    docker run -d --restart=always -p 3000:3000 --cap-drop=all sudoku
