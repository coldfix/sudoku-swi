Lightweight Static Web Interface for sudoku generator, visible on
sudoku.coldfix.de_.

This is coded in illegably ugly PHPâ€¦ shame on me. Please, don't blame me for
the mistakes I've done years ago.

The thing itself isn't really useful, but I had already coded the sudoku
generator a while back when I was in school, so it wasn't much effort to
provide a web-interface. I am now setting the code free, so you can decide on
your own, whether you want to look at such ugliness.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Put the folder somewhere in your webroot, enable PHP.

Build the generator_ and put the ``sudoku`` binary in this folder.
