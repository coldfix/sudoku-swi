sudoku-cli
----------

Simple command line interface for a sudoku generator.

Be warned, I coded this as a teenager in between 2006-2011 and only imported
into git later. The code is in horrible C++0x (as it was called back then)
with only the features that were supported by the latest version of g++ 4.5 ;)

- g++

**NOTE:** you shouldn't goo higher than 5v5 â€“ the algorithm is really bad and
will take forever.
